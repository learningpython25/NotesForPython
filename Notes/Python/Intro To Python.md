A **programming language** is a way to communicate with computers to perform tasks.

### Language Hierarchy

| Level        | Language Examples  | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Machine Code | `0` / `1` (Binary) | Direct hardware instructions                   |
| Low-Level    | C, C++             | Closer to machine; faster, but harder to write |
| High-Level   | Python, Java       | Human-readable; easier to learn and use        |

## What is Python?

* **Python** is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **open-source** programming language.
* Created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**.
* Known for **readability**, **simplicity**, and a huge **community ecosystem**.

### Key Features

* **Readable Syntax**: English-like code.
* **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare data types.
* **Indentation-Based Structure**: Blocks defined by whitespace (no `{}` or `;`).
* **Interpreted Language**: Code runs line-by-line, not compiled beforehand.
* **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux.

## Python Versioning

Example: **Python 3.12.2**

* `3` → **Major Version**
* `12` → **Minor Version**
* `2` → **Patch Version**

> **Python 2** is obsolete. Use **Python 3.10+**

## Why Learn Python?

* Beginner-friendly, ideal for newcomers.
* Widely used in:

  * Web development 
  * Data science 
  * Machine learning 
  * Automation 
  * Game development 
  * Scripting and tools 
* Huge standard library + 450,000+ third-party packages.

## Example: Dynamic Typing

```python
greet = "Hello"   # str
greet = 123       # now int
```

No need to specify data types — Python figures it out for you.

## Python Libraries & Package Management

* **Standard Library**: Comes with Python (e.g., `math`, `datetime`, `os`)
* **Third-Party Libraries**: Available via **PyPI (Python Package Index)**

* 450,000+ packages for everything from ML to game dev
* **PIP**: Tool to install packages

  ```bash
  pip install package-name
  ```

## Source Control

Version control helps manage code changes and collaborate.

* **Git**: Tool for tracking changes
* **Online Repositories**:
  * GitHub
  * GitLab
  * Bitbucket

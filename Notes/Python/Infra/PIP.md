- PIP = Pip Installs Packages
- To make you use the correct version of pip for your python interpreter run it like below. Refere [here](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#running-pip-as-a-module) for more details
	- `python -m p`. 
- You can install from github as well by using the flag `git+https`

> You’re not limited to packages hosted on PyPI or other package indexes. `pip` also provides the option to install packages from a [GitHub repository](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/). But even when a package is hosted on PyPI, like the [Real Python directory tree generator](https://pypi.org/project/rptree/), you can opt to install it from its [Git repository](https://github.com/realpython/rptree):
> **`$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/realpython/rptree`**
> This command tells pip to install the package from the specified Git repository by [using the `git+https` scheme with the repository URL](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#installing-packages-from-your-github-repositories).

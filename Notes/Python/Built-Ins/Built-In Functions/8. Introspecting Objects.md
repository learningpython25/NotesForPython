#### **`id()`**
- Returns the identity of an object
- This identity is like a unique key, like Aadhar Number, which is used to identify that object during its life time, like a number plate. If the number plate dies, it can be re-assigned to someone.
- `id()` function is used to find its unique number
- In `cpython` this id, is usually the memory addres of the object where the object lives

**Examples**
```python
a = "hello"
id(a)
>>> 3197667674320
a = "world"
id(a)
>>> 3197673350288


lst = ["a", "b"]
id(lst)
>>> 3197673474880
lst[0] = "c"
lst[1] = "d"
id(lst)
>>> 3197673474880
```

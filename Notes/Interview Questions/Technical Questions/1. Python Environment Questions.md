## Day 1

###### 1. What is `__name__` in Python? Where is it used?
* `__name__` is a special built-in variable in Python.
* It tells you whether a file is being **run directly** or **imported as a module**.
* Commonly used in:

  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      # This block runs only when the file is executed directly
  ```

###### 2. What are dunders in Python? Give some examples.
* **"Dunders"** = **"Double Underscores"**, e.g., `__name__`, `__init__`, `__str__`
* They are special (often built-in) **magic methods** or variables.
* Examples:
  * `__init__()` → Constructor for classes
  * `__str__()` → String representation of an object
  * `__len__()` → Returns length when `len(obj)` is called
  * `__name__` → Module name or `"__main__"`

## Day 2
###### 5. What is version control (Git)?
- **Version control** is a system that tracks changes in files over time.
- **Git** is a **distributed version control system** that lets multiple developers collaborate, track file history, and manage changes efficiently.
- Key benefits:
    - Revert to previous versions
    - Branching and merging for feature development
    - Collaboration and backup

from math import sqrt            # Imports only the sqrt function
from math import *               # Imports everything (not recommended)
import math as m                 # Imports module with alias
```
